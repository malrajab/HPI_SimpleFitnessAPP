# HPI_SimpleFitnessAPP

An advanced attempt to read mobile sensors information and storing this in a local db.

The information captured from the sensors are used to create the steps count and compute the consumed calories of the user.

First, the user needs to login using a registration page if not already exist. All data validation is done so that the db stays clean.
A forget password page is also provided.

The visualization part is not included in this copy. Contact me if needed.
